          Banner Eyewear was developed so people could create and purchase 3D printed sunglasses.
          The create page has an advanced user interface, where text is warped and extruded, rendering a realistic 3D representation of the real product.
          Just type text and see that text warped to fit the temples.
          You can also change the font, ear tip icons, and colors.
